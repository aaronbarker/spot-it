# spot-it
An attempt at making a spot it like game where you can provide your own text or images

This is pretty quick and dirty (ok, quick === a whole weekend). I played the spot-it game and thought it would be fun to use my own images, family images, etc. I found a few Stack Overflow articles talking about the logic, but it was all way beyond me.  Found another site that listed out the results of the confusing logic as to how many items were needed, how many cards would be as a result, and what items went on what cards.  I figured I could set up some logic to output that to a page. That became a quick and dirty game, then dynamically entereing content, then saving content, etc.

I don't pretend to think this code is bulletproof, good, or otherwise.  But it serves its purpose in that it takes data and creates cards for printing out.  Hopefully others find it useful as well.
